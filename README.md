## TOPIC: VISUALIZATION OF NEWTON'S LAW OF MOTION

*** First law ***
In an inertial frame of reference, an object remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force

*** Second law ***
In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: 
* F = ma *

*** Third law ***
All forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction.
